# Human Chat Simulator
A chatbot is an AI agent that can participate in a conversation with a user. Most are equipped with a messenger type interface with an input from a user and an output from the chatbot. The chatbot processes the users input and outputs a reply based on what the user has just sent. Most basic chatbots work by matching an users input with a predefined set of dialog. For example, a user saying “Thank you” will result in the chatbot saying “You’re Welcome”. The predefined set of dialogues can be set up to imitate a normal conversation between two people.

Simulating a human bot can easily allow users to engage in a natural way as if they are actually having a conversation with a human. Since chatbots are always online, it’s a straightforward way of enabling 24/7 support without human presence.

RESPONSIBILITIES OF A CHATBOT:
-A chatbot chat interface must be accessible and intuitive.
-Must understand the customer or user inputs by identifying user intent and extract relevant entities.
-Must be able to give an appropriate answer by fetching information from the database. The answers offered should be human-like to give a human feel to the answers.
