A chatbot is an AI agent that can participate in a conversation with a user. Most are equipped with a messenger type interface with an input from a user and an output from the chatbot. The chatbot processes the users input and outputs a reply based on what the user has just sent. Most basic chatbots work by matching an users input with a predefined set of dialog. For example, a user saying “Thank you” will result in the chatbot saying “You’re Welcome”. The predefined set of dialogues can be set up to imitate a normal conversation between two people.
